# HW6-HMM

In this assignment, you'll implement the Viterbi Algorithm (dynamic programming). 


# Assignment

## Overview 

The goal of this assignment is to implement the Viterbi algorithm to ---- for HMMs. 

For a refresher on the HMMS you can check out [this overview](insert link here) 





Consider the scope of the inputs and how the different parameters of the input data could break the bounds of your implementation.
  * Consider the parameters blah blah blah 
  * Do your model probabilites sum up to the correct values? 
  * come up with some edge cases 
  * How will your model handle zero-probability transitions? 



## Tasks

[TODO] Complete the ViterbiAlgorithm class with your implementation of the algorithm

  [x] complete the `viterbi` method  
  [x] complete the `backtrace` method  


[TODO] Unit Testing  
  [x] HiddenMarkovModel Class 
  [x] ViterbiAlgorithm Class

[TODO] Packaging 
  [x] updated readme with 
  [x] pip installable module (optional)
  [x] github actions (install + pytest) (optional)


## Completing the Assignment
